# Fractal and Multifractal Time Series

The scripts here developed are related to fractal and multifractal time series. Those scripts include not only algorithms to extract information from time series, but also to generate time series and modify them. 

The scripts are divided in two folders: 'thesis' and 'others'. All of them are written in Matlab. The first contains the algorithms used in my master thesis ([link to the thesis](http://mtc-m21b.sid.inpe.br/col/sid.inpe.br/mtc-m21b/2016/04.20.19.52/doc/publicacao.pdf)). A summary of them can be seen in the Table below:

| # | Scipt Name | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | abmp.m | Calculates multifractal spectrum using binomial multiplicative process |
| 2 | addTrend.m | Add polynomial trends to time series |
| 3 | apmodel.m | Calculates multifractal spectrum using p-model |
| 4 | dfa.m | Detrended Fluctuation Analysis |
| 5 | emd.m | Empirical Mode Decomposition (or Hilbert-Huang Transform) |
| 6 | ffiltering.m | Generates time series using Fourier Filtering |
| 7 | gpmodel.m | Generates multifractal time series using p-model |
| 8 | logscales.m | Generates exponentially spaced numbers |
| 9 | mfdfa.m | Multifractal DFA |
| 10 | mffiltering.m | Generates time series using Modified Fourier Filtering |
| 11 | powspec.m | Power Spectrum |

The remaining scripts are in the folder named 'others' and they were not used in the thesis. A summary of them can be seen below:

| # | Scipt Name | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | detStaircase.m | Generates a time series (discrete staircase) |
| 2 | fracBM.m | Generates a time series based on Brownian Motion |
| 3 | genStaircase.m | Generates a time series |
| 4 | mfwmm.m | Multifractal Spectrum using Wavelet Transform |
| 5 | randStaircase.m | Generates a time series (random Staircase) |
| 6 | whiteBM.m | Generates a time series based on Brownian Motion |
